Found bugs from automation testcases:
1, test_create_same_category_twice()
- in this case the expected behaviour would be do not allow to create same category name twice

Found bugs from manual test of the frontend:

1, During editing a task I noticed that while rewriting 'Title' or 'Description' the input field looses the focus after each letter
Expected behaviour: 
Editing input fields should be seamless.

2, Adding new task with empty "Description" field
The page allows to save new task with empty "Description", but the task did not created.
Expected behaviour:
The page should visually show that the "Description" field is mandatory, and not allow to save change

3, Adding new task with empty "Date" field
The page allows to save new task with empty "Date", but the task did not created.
Expected behaviour:
The page should visually show that the "Date" field is mandatory, and not allow to save change

4, Better visualisation of the "Done" or "Finished" tasks
From the user perspective the current function behind it is not intuitive.
I would suggest not to delete the finished task from the table, but make it somehow as a "strikethrough element"

5, Warn a user when a category is deleted for a task
Here I would give a warning to the user about the corresponding task will not linked to any category and the task(s) also will be deleted

6, Saving task after it has been deleted
Reproduction:
- Step1: create a new category
- Step2: create a task for the category
- Step3: Edit the task
- Step4: Mark task as done/finished (task should be dissappear from the list)
- Step5: Rename task original Title and Description (edit fields are still shown on page)
- Step6: Commit the new Title and Description with "Save changes" button
Notice that the task did not saved
Expected behaviour:
- new task has been saved
